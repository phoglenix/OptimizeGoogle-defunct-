ABOUT OPTIMIZEGOOGLE

OptimizeGoogle is a Firefox extension that enhances Google search results by adding extra
information (like links to Yahoo, Ask, MSN etc) and removing unwanted information (like
ads and spam). All features are optional. This extension was created to maintain and
improve the CustomizeGoogle extension developed by Daniel, which seems to have been abandoned,
falling behind the changes which Google has been making to their pages.
