	Added : Sticky Google Preferences
	        http://www.Customize.com/sticky-google-preferences.html

			- If you clear your cookies often
			- If you want to make sure that your children won't find explicit text and images
			- If you want to propagate your preferences to several Google domains

	Update: Streaming search result pages is now compatible with:
	        - Customize (such as filters, history and bookmarks)
	        - Most (but not all) extensions and userscripts
			
              A note to other developers:
			  ---------------------------

			  If your extension/userscript doesn't work with Customize Streaming search result pages,
			  make sure that your script executes on the 'DOMContentLoaded' event (not the 'load' event).

			  If you're modifying the Google search result in such a way that it doesn't affect the individual
			  results, then you can now check if the google url ends with #disable-userscript. If it does you
			  can use this knowledge to disable your userscript when Customize fetches the next search
			  result pages. If your userscript doesn't modify the individual results, then it doesn't need to
			  execute. How to do this in a Greasemonkey userscript:
			  @exclude http://*google.*/*#disable-userscript
